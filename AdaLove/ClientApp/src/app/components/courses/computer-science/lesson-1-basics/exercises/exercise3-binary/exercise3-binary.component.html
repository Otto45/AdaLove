                <span>Guess what? The only new thing you need to know to understand binary is that it's base-2 instead of base-10.</span>
                <span>This means there are only two integer values a digit can have, 1 and 0.</span>
                <span>Using our knowledge of how number systems work, we can represent the number "13" in binary like this:</span>
