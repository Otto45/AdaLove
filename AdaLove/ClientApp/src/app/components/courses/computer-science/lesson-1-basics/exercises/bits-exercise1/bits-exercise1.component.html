            <span>Why would anyone create a number system that only uses 2 integer values? Seems inconvenient right?</span>
            <span>Not to a computer! They run on electricity, which if you remember from science class, is basically a bunch of electrons moving very fast in a circuit.</span>
            <span>Because electricity moves so fast, they can perform calculations way faster than a human ever could.</span>
            <span>How does a computer store information? It depends on the hardware.</span>
            <span>In the CPU and RAM, it stores an electrical charge in a special circuit, kind of like a battery.</span>
            <span>When it needs to read the value stored, it simply checks if there is an electrical charge (On) or not (Off).</span>
            <span>Coming full circle, because a computer only knows two things, On or Off, it needs a number system it can perform any calculation with using only two values.</span>
            <span>Sound familiar? It should, it's Binary!</span>
            <span>In computer science, we refer to a single unit that stores On or Off (1 or 0) as a bit.</span>
            <span>Bits are the basic building blocks of anything represented in a computer, and computers now have trillions of them.</span>
            <span>Next time you're playing or watching someone play a video game, just think that there are trillions of bits switched On or Off that represent everything you see!</span>
